Basic Weather Application

Objective: 
1. The objective of this project is to create a simple Python application that retrieves real-time weather information for a given city using an API.
2. This project helps in understanding how to work with APIs, handle JSON data, and display useful information to the user.

Tools Used: 
Python – Programming language for logic
Requests Library – Used to send HTTP requests to the weather API
VS Code – IDE used to write and run Python code
OpenWeatherMap API – Provides real time weather data

Functionality:
- Connects to the OpenWeatherMap API using an API key
- Fetches real-time weather data for the entered city
- Displays the current temperature in Celsius
- Displays a brief weather description
- Handles invalid city names and shows an error message

Conclusion:
This project successfully demonstrates how Python can be used to access live weather data through the OpenWeatherMap API.
By taking user input and displaying the current temperature and weather description, the program provides accurate and real-time information.
It also improves basic programming skills such as API handling, error checking, and data processing.
