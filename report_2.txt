Random Password Generator Report

Objective: To create a Python program that generates secure, random passwords based on user-selected criteria like length and character types.

Tools Used: 
Python – Programming language for calculations and logic
VS Code – IDE used to write and run Python code

Functionality:
- Run the Python program.
- Enter the desired password length.
- Choose whether to include letters, numbers, and symbols by typing yes or no.
- The program will generate and display a random password.

Conclusion:
=> Understanding randomization in Python.
=> Working with strings and character sets.
=> Handling user input and exceptions.
=> Using Boolean variables to control program logic.
